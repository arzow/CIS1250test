  <h2>Write a short paragraph (up to 300 words) addressing the following points: Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why.</h2>
  <p>One software application that I frequently use and consider to be exceptionally well-designed is Spotify. Its minimalistic GUI makes it easy to navigate, allowing users to find what they need without any hassle. The consistent black and green color scheme throughout the app helps establish a strong brand identity while maintaining a clean look. A standout feature of Spotify is its annual “Spotify Wrapped” event, which provides users a personalized overview of their listening habits, presented in a trendy slideshow. Many users look forward to this event, as it highlights their favorite songs and artists and creates a shared experience among friends and family. Spotify's unique followers feature lets users see what their friends are listening to, fostering a sense of community. Moreover, Spotify offers personalized playlists and recommendations tailored to users' tastes. Using advanced algorithms, the platform helps users discover new artists and genres, enhancing their listening experience. In summary, Spotify’s thoughtful design, engaging features, and social connectivity contribute to its popularity in the music streaming industry, making it a platform that many users, including myself, truly enjoy.</p>
  
  <h2>Why is software design important?</h2>
  <p>Software design is a critical component in establishing a strong foundation for a successful project. The saying "failing to plan is planning to fail" illustrates the importance of this process. A well-defined software design provides clear direction and facilitates seamless workflow, allowing the entire project to be outlined effectively.</p>

  <h1>WA2</h1>
  <h2>Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process.</h2>
  <p>In the requirements gathering stage of the software development process, the development team interacts closely with the client or potential users. This stage involves generating comprehensive insights into their expectations for the software. They ask questions such as: What problems should this software solve? What objectives should it achieve? Who are the users? What constraints, such as budget and time, must be considered? This stage is vital for a successful project as it sets the foundation for all subsequent stages of the software development cycle. A clear understanding of the project vision will help create a smooth flow of progress and reduce misunderstandings later on. Neglecting to complete this stage thoroughly can result in project delays, increased costs, and complications such as requirements bloat and creep.</p>
  
  <h2>Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in Writing Assignment 1. Write 5 user stories for that software.</h2>
  <p>
    1. As a user, I want to search for songs by name, artist, or album, so that I can easily access the music I want to listen to.<br>
    2. As a user, I want to download songs and albums, so that I can listen offline without using data.<br>
    3. As an artist, I want to export high-quality files of my music to the software, so that my listeners can access the best quality music.<br>
    4. As an artist, I want to upload album titles, credits, release dates, and covers, so that I can build a brand identity around my releases.<br>
    5. As a music distributor, I want to see total streams collected on each song every month, so that I can ensure the artists under my label are paid properly.
