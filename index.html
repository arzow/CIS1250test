<h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
<body>
  <h2>Write a short paragraph (up to 300 words) addressing the following points: Give an example of a software that you 
    personally used that you think was designed well and explain why.</h2>
  <p>One software application that I frequently use and consider to be exceptionally well-designed is Spotify. 
    It’s minimalistic GUI makes it easy to navigate, allowing users to find what they need without any hassle. The consistent 
    black and green colour scheme throughout the app helps establish a strong brand identity while maintaining a clean and minimalistic
    look. A standout feature of Spotify is its annual “Spotify Wrapped” event. This feature gives users a personalised overview of their 
    listening habits from the past year, presented in a trendy slideshow. Many users look forward to this event, as it not only highlights 
    their favourite songs and artists but also creates a shared experience among friends and family. Spotify also includes a unique followers 
    and following feature letting users see what their friends are listening to. This social aspect sets Spotify apart from other music streaming
    services, such as Apple Music, which do not offer similar experiences. This connection makes a sense of community among users and enhances 
    the overall experience. Moreover, Spotify provides personalised playlists and music recommendations tailored to all users. Using advanced 
    algorithms, the platform helps users discover new artists and genres, broadening their musical tastes and enhancing their listening experience.
    In summary, Spotify’s thoughtful design, engaging features, and social connectivity contribute to its popularity in the music streaming industry.
    The combination of user-friendly functionality and unique elements makes Spotify standout in the industry and a platform that many users, 
    including myself, truly enjoy.

  <h2> Why is software design important?
</h2>
  <p>Software design is a critical component in establishing a strong foundation for a successful project. The saying "failing to plan is 
    planning to fail" demonstrates the importance of this process. Furthermore, a well-defined software design provides a clear direction and 
    facilitates a seamless workflow, as it allows for the entire project to be outlined and put on paper. </h2>

<h1> Writing Assignment 2
</h1>

  <h2>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is 
    important for the entire software development process.
  </h2>
  <p>
  In the requirements gathering stage of the software development process the development team interacts closely with the client, or potential users. 
    This stage involves generating comprehensive insights into their expectations for the software. They pose questions such as what problems should 
    this software solve? What objectives should it achieve? Who are the users? What constraints, such as budget, time, etc. must be considered? This 
    stage is vital for a successful project as it sets the foundation for all subsequent stages of the software development cycle. A clear understanding 
    of the vision of the project will help in creating a smooth flow of the project progress, and aid in reducing misunderstandings later on. Neglecting 
    to complete this stage thoroughly with an eye to detail will result in several consequences including project delays due to unclear objectives leaving 
    the development team confused, increased costs can occur due to these delays, reducing the budget and resources. Additionally, poor requirement gathering 
    can lead to requirements bloat (where unnecessary features complicate the software), and requirements creep (where new requirements grow later on, due to
    unaddressed requirements).

  <h2>Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in Writing Assignment 1 (Note: In Writing Assignment 1 you were asked to give an 
  example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why). Write 5 user stories for that software. (Recall the user 
  story template: As a <user type>, I want <some action/function>, so that <some reason> )
</h2>

<p>1. As a user, I want to search for songs by song name, artist name, or album name, so that I can easily access the music I want to listen to <br>
   2. As a user, I want to be able to download songs and albums, so that I can listen to their content offline without using data <br>
   3. As an artist, I want to be able to export high quality files of my music to the software, so that my listeners can access the best quality music <br>

   5. As a music distributor, I want to be able to see all the total streams collected on each song every month, so that I can ensure the artist under my label in being paid properly
